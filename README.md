# gsh
A shell written in Java that I have plans to use in other projects.

    

List of commands:

"ls" - list files in current directory

"cd" - change directory

"pwd" - print working directory

"cat" - concatenate files

"exit" - exit gsh

"exec" - execute a application

"ping" - ping a host

"help" - print this list of commands

"clear" - clear the screen, "cls" also works

"echo" - print text

"cat" - read the contents of a file

"touch" - create a file

"rm" - remove a file or directory

"mkdir" - create a directory

"edit" - edit a file
